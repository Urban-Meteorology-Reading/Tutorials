.. _SEBE:

Solar Energy - Introduction to SEBE
===================================

Introduction
------------

Lindberg et al.’s (2015) solar radiation model SEBE (Solar Energy on
Building Envelopes) allows estimates of solar irradiance on ground
surfaces, building roofs and walls. It uses a shadow casting algorithm
with a digital surface model (**DSM**) and the solar position to
generate pixel-level information of shadow or sunlit areas. The shadow
casting algorithm (Ratti and Richens 1999) has been developed to
incorporate walls (Lindberg et al. 2015). This is of interest for a
broad range of applications, for example solar energy potential and
thermal comfort.

SEBE is incorporated in `UMEP (Urban Multi-scale Environmental
Predictor) <http://umep-docs.readthedocs.io>`__, a plugin for
`QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`__. As SEBE was initially developed to
estimate solar energy potential on building roofs, the Digital Surface
Models (DSMs) used need to include roof structures, such as tilted
roofs, chimneys etc. Methods to produce accurate ground and building
DSMs for SEBE include the use of LiDAR technology and 3D roof structure
objects in vector format.

In this exercise you will apply the model in `Gothenburg,
Sweden <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothenburg>`__ and `Covent
Garden <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covent_Garden>`__, London to
investigate solar energy potential, how it changes between buildings,
with seasons, with the effects of vegetation etc.

Initial Practical steps
-----------------------

-  If **QGIS** and **UMEP** is not on your computer you will `need to install it <http://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting_Started.html>`__
-  Start the QGIS software
-  *Windows:* If not visible on the desktop use the **Start** button to
   find the software (i.e. Find QGIS under your applications)
-  Select **QGIS 3.12 Desktop** (or the latest version installed).

When you open it on the top toolbar you will see **UMEP**.

Steps
-----

#. Start with the Gothenbrug data. The data is zipped - unzip the data first.
#. Examine the geodata by adding the layers to your project.
#. Use *Layer > Add Layer > Add Raster Layer* to open the .tif and .asc raster files and *Layer > Add Layer > Add Vector Layer*. The Vector layer is a shape file which consists of multiple files. It is the **building.shp** that should be used to load the vector layer into QGIS.
#. You will need to indicate the coordinate reference system (`CRS <https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_projections/working_with_projections.html>`__) for the **CDSM_KRbig.asc** dataset.

    - Right-click on **CDSM_KRbig** and go to *Set CRS > Set Layer CRS...*. Choose EPSG:3007. You can use the filter to search for the correct CRS. 

#. Open the meteorological (**GBG_TMY_1977.txt**) file in a text editor or in a spreadsheet such as MS excel or LibreOffice (Open office).

   -  Data file is formatted for the UMEP plugin (in general) and the
      SEBE plugin (in particular).
   -  First four columns are *time related*.
   -  Columns of interest are **kdown, kdiff and kdir**. These are
      related to shortwave radiation and give global, diffuse and direct
      radiation, respectively.
   -  The meteorological file should preferably be at least a year long. Multi-year data improves the solar energy estimation.
   -  One option is to use a `typical meteorological
      year <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_meteorological_year>`__
      as you will do in this tutorial

**Variables included in the meteorological data file:**

**No.** indicates the column of the variable in the file. **Use** indicates if it is *R – required* or
*O- optional* (in this application) or *N- Not used in this
application*. All columns must be present but can be filled with
numbers to indicate they are not in use (e.g. -999).

Preparing data for SEBE
-----------------------
Required inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SEBE plugin: located at *UMEP > Processor > Solar Energy > Solar Energy on Building Envelopes (SEBE)* in the menu bar.

.. figure:: /images/SEBE_SEBE1.png
   :alt: SEBE1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 514px

   The interface for SEBE in UMEP

#. Building and ground DSM's.

   -  Critical for the calculations in SEBE is the **building and ground**
      `DSM <http://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Abbreviations.html>`__.
   -  Optionally **vegetation** (trees and bushes) can be included as
      they can shadow ground, walls and roofs reducing the potential
      solar energy production.
   -  Two vegetation DSMs are required when the *Use vegetation DSMs* is
      ticked:

      + One to describe the top of the vegetation (Vegetation Canopy DSM).

      + One to describe the bottom, underneath the canopies (Vegetation Trunk Zone DSM).

      As Trunk Zone DSMs are very rare, an option to create this from the
      canopy DSM is available. You can set the amount of light (shortwave radiation) that is transmitted through the vegetation.

#. Two raster datasets, height and wall aspect, are needed to calculate
   irradiance on building walls.
#. The average albedo (one value is used for all surfaces) can be changed.
#. The
   `UTC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time>`__
   offset is needed to accurately estimate the sun position; positive
   numbers for easterly positions, relative to the `prime meridian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian>`_, and negative for westerly. For example,
   Gothenburg is located in CET timezone which is UTC +1.
#. The meteorological file needs to be specified.

Pre-processing: wall height and aspect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Wall data is created with the `UMEP plugin - Wall Height and
   Aspect <http://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pre-processor/Urban%20Geometry%20Wall%20Height%20and%20Aspect.html>`__:

   - The wall height algorithm uses a 3 by 3 pixels kernel minimum filter where the four cardinal points (N, W, S,E) are investigated. The pixels just ‘inside’ the buildings are identified and give values to indicate they are a building edge. The aspect algorithm originates from a linear filtering technique (Goodwin et al. 2009). It identifies the linear features plus (a new addition) the aspect of the identified line. Other more accurate techniques include using a vector building layer and spatially relating this to the wall pixels.
#. Close the SEBE plugin (if open) and open the Wall and Height and Aspect plugin (*UMEP > Pre-Processor > Urban Geometry > Wall Height and Aspect*).
#. Use your ground and building DSM (in this case *DSM_KRbig*) as input.
#. Tick the option to Calculate wall aspect.
#. Create a folder in your *Documents* folder called e.g. **SEBETutorial**.
#. Name your new raster datasets **wallaspect.tif** and **wallheight.tif**, respectively, and save them in your **SEBETutorial** folder.
#. Tick *Add result to project*
#. Click *Run* to create the rasters.
#. Once the window stating that it has run successfully appears, you can close the *Wall Height* window.

Running the model
-----------------

Now you have all data ready to run the model.

.. figure:: /images/SEBE_SEBEnoVeg.jpg
   :alt:  Settings for running SEBE without vegetation.

   Example of settings for running SEBE without vegetation.

#. First run the model *without* including vegetation.

   -  Open the SEBE-plugin.
   -  Configure the settings according to the figure above.
   -  Save your results in a subfolder (**NoVeg**) of **SEBETutorial**.
   -  The model takes some time to calculate irradiance on all the
      surfaces.
   -  The result added to your map canvas is the horizontal radiation,
      i.e. irradiance on the ground and roofs.

#. Run the model again but this time also use the vegetation DSM.

   -  Save your result in a subfolder called **Veg**.

Irradiance on building envelopes
--------------------------------

.. note:: Currently, this section works only on a windows computer. **3D Visualisation for Mac and Linux currently not working properly**

To determine the irradiance on building walls:

#. Open the SunAnalyser located at *UMEP > Post-Processor > Solar
   Radiation > SEBE (Visualisation)*.

   -  This can be used to visualize the irradiance on both roofs and
      walls.

#. Choose the input folder where you saved your result for one of the
   runs.
#. Click *Area of Visualisation*
#. Click once on the canvas to initiate the visualisation area and then drag to produce an area
#. Click again to finish.
#. Click Visualise. Now you should be able to see the results in 3D.

Use the **Profile tool**, which is a plugin for QGIS, to see the range of values along a transect.

#. *Plugins > Profile tool > Terrain profile.* If this is not installed you will need to install it from official
   QGIS-plugin reporistory (*Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins*).

   -  Draw a line across the screen on the area of interest. Double
      click and you will see the profile drawn. Make certain you use the
      correct layer (see Tips).
   
Solar Energy Potential
----------------------

In order to obtain the solar energy potential for a specific building:

#. The actual area of the roof needs to be considered.
#. Determine the area of each pixel (A\ :sub:`P`): e.g. 1 m\ :sup:`2`
#. As some roofs are tilting the area may be larger for some pixels. The
   actual area (*A*\ :sub:`A`) can be computed from:

      *A*\ :sub:`A` = *A*\ :sub:`P` / *cos(S*\ :sub:`i`)

      where the slope (*S*\ :sub:`i`) of the raster pixel should be in radians (1 deg = pi/180 rad).

**To create a slope raster:**

#. *Raster > Analysis > Slope*.
#. Use the DSM for the elevation layer.
#. Create the slope z factor =1 - area

.. figure:: /images/SEBE_SlopeQGIS3.jpg
   :alt: None
   :width: 75%
   :align: center

   The Slope tool in QGIS3

#. Now determine the area after you have removed the wall area ( assumed to have slope greater than 65) from the
   buildings
#. Open the raster calculator: *Raster > Raster Calculator*.
#. Enter the equation indicated in the figure below.

    .. figure:: /images/SEBE_RasterCalculator.jpg
        :alt: None
        :width: 100%
        :align: center

        The RasterCalculator in QGIS3. Click on image for enlargement.

#. To visualize where to place solar panels, the amount of energy
   received needs to be cost effective. As irradiance below 900 kWh is
   considered to be too low for solar energy production (*Per Jonsson
   personal communication Tyréns Consultancy*), pixels lower than
   900 can be filtered out (Figure below). Changing transparency allows you to
   make only points above a threshold of interest visible.

   -  Right-click on the Energyyearroof-layer and go to **Properties**
      and then **Transparency**.
   -  Add a custom transparency (green cross) where values between 0 and
      900 are set to 100% transparency.



Irradiance map with values less than 900 kWh filtered out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To estimate solar potential on building roofs we can use the Zonal
statistics tool:

#. *Processing > Toolbox* then search *Zonal statistics*. Be sure to avoid *Raster layer zonal statistics*.

   -  Use the roof area raster layer (**energy_per_m2_slope65_roofarea**)
      created before and use **building.shp** as the polygon layer to
      calculate as your zone layer.
#. On your building layer – Right click *Open Attribute Table*
#. Or use *identify features* to click a building (polygon) of interest to
   see the statistics you have just calculated

   Note that we will not consider the performance of the solar panels.

Covent Garden data set
----------------------

A second GIS data set is available for the Covent Garden area in London

#. Close the Gothenburg data (it may be easiest to completely close QGIS
   and re-open).
#. Download from the link given in the beginning of this tutorial.
#. Extract the data to a directory.
#. Load the Raster data files (as you did before).
#. Additional analysis: Shadows

   -  `UMEP > Processor > Solar Radiation > Daily Shadow
      pattern <http://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processor/Solar%20Radiation%20Daily%20Shadow%20Pattern.html>`__
   -  Allows you to calculate the shadows for a particular time of day
      and `Day of
      Year <https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/browse/calendar.html>`__.

Questions for you to explore with UMEP:SEBE
-------------------------------------------

#. Use the Gothenburg dataset consider the impact of vegetation.

   -  What are the main differences between the two model runs with
      respect to ground and roof surfaces?
   -  To what extent are the building roofs affected by vegetation?

#. Consider the differences between London and Gothenburg. You can run
   the model for different times of the year by modifying the
   meteorological data so the file only has the period of interest.
#. For Covent Garden, determine the solar energy potential for a
   specific building within the model domain. Work in groups to consider
   different areas. What would be the impact of having a smaller/larger
   area domain modelled for this building? Identify the possibilities of
   solar energy production for that building.
