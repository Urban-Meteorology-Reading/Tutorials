.. _LidarProcessing:

Spatial data - Generating UMEP input data from a LiDAR point cloud
==================================================================

.. note:: This tutorial is making use of `FUSION/LDV <http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/fusion.html.>`__ which makes it restricted to Windows OS only.


The purpose of this tutorial is to create spatial input data for UMEP 
and get familiar with some of the various
tools available in QGIS concerning processing of data obtained by the
airborne LiDAR technology. 

You will get acquainted with FUSION/LDV,
a so-called free software (not to be confused with Freeware or open
source) developed to process point clouds. The exercise focuses on the
city and how to make use of LiDAR data in urban environments.

The exercise is divided in two parts:

1. In the first part you will get acquainted with some different
   features that are available in QGIS and how to use other open source
   software within QGIS. You will also learn how to use FUSION
   effectively using the Windows Command Prompt. The end products will be a DSM and CDSM. This part of the tutorial is losely based upon the method presented in Lindberg and Grimmond (2011).

2. In the second part, you will create a basic land cover data using QGIS/FUSION. This part of the tutorial is losely based upon the method presented in Hedblom et al. (2017).

PART 1 - Creating DSM and CDSM
------------------------------

QGIS graphical interfaces and settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise, you will work with an area around Earth Science Center in
Gothenburg, Sweden. The dataset consists of a number of vector layers
from Lantmäteriets (Swedish Cadastral and Mapping Authority)
Fastighetskarta and a laser point cloud derived from the National
Elevation Model (NH) in Sweden. 

In this exercise you will make use of the *Processing
Toolbox* (right side of Figure 1) where many of the geoprocessing
algorithms are found, both from the QGIS core and from other open
source software and libraries such as GDAL, GRASS, SAGA GIS, R, FUSION, UMEP
etc. If the toolbox is unavailable, go to *Processing* and click on
*Toolbox*.

Next step is to download and activate the plugin that makes it possible
to use the FUSION software within QGIS3.

FUSION is a freeware (Free Software) without restrictions, developed
especially for using LiDAR technology in forestry, but it can also be
used in other applications. FUSION can be downloaded from
http://forsys.sefs.uw.edu/fusion/fusionlatest.html. Make sure that FUSION
is installed at **C:\\FUSION**. If not, locate the FUSION folder and
remember its location. Now go to *Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins*,
search for *FUSION*, click on *FUSION for Processing* and click *Install
Plugin*. This is a processing plugin porting many of the FUSION tools directly into the QGIS processing framework.

   Figure 2. The Plugin Manager in QGIS 3.6.

To make use of FUSION inside QGIS you have to configure some initial
settings. In the *Processing Toolbox*, click on the monkey wrench
(*Options*) and configure FUSION as shown in Figure 3. Remember to point
to the directory where FUSION is installed on your system. If
successful, a FUISON-menu should have appeared in the Processing
toolbox.

Get started with FUSION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start by examining the point cloud that you will make use of for the
rest of this exercise. The data can be downloaded from `here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B31bjOSjDDdxME5vd1VMS25IZjg/view>`__ (link also at end of this document). All data is projected in **SWEREF99 TM
(EPSG:3006)** so it is very important to specify this when you add your
data into QGIS. Save the data in a location where you have rights to
read and write, e.g. the Desktop or a USB-stick. In the *Processing Toolbox*
go to *FUSION > Visualisation > Open viewer* and open **gvc.las**.
Examine your point cloud. Make use of the **help (?)** button to find
out which classes are within this particular point cloud. As you will discover, this is a very basic point cloud including only two classes (ground and unclassified).

Expand FUSION in the Processing Toolbox. Here you will find a number of
FUSION algorithms, divided up into different categories. This is far from all that FUSION can do. The full manual of FUSION is available from:
http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/Software/FUSION/FUSION_manual.pdf. In
this document you can find specification on all the algorithms available
in FUSION. We will also look at how to use the algorithms that are not
available from within the graphical interface of QGIS.

As the ground points were already classified in the point cloud, you can
now generate a digital elevation model. If the point cloud would have been
unclassified, you could have exploited the **Ground Filter** to filter out
ground points. Open *FUSION >
Surface > Grid Surface Create* and configure the following settings (Figure 4), before clicking *Run*. Remember to save your data at an location
where you have read and write access on your system.

.. figure:: /images/Lidar4.jpg

   Figure 4. Setting for **Grid Surface Create** when creating a DEM.

For all the elevation models that we create in connection with this
exercise, we will use the 2-meter resolution as this is what the point
cloud is originally designed for. *Grid Create Surface* can only
save so-called **.dtm**-files, which is a in-house file format in FUISON.
This file cannot be opened in QGIS but we can study our soil model using
FUSION LAS viewer (Figure 5).


.. figure:: /images/Lidar5.jpg
   :alt:  none
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Figure 5. Ground.dtm.

As you can see there are a variety of settings to configure in **Grid
Surface Create**. To see what they all do, you can study FUSION Manual.
To create a geoTIFF grid from your **.dtm** file we will use a FUSION
algorithm outside of QGIS. This method is important to be familiar
with when you want to use FUSION for other purposes, such as
creating automated scripts etc, later on. Therefore, it is very useful to learn
how to make use of the FUSION algorithms from the Windows Command
Prompt.

Go to the Start menu in Windows and open the *Command Prompt* (you can
search for *cmd* if you cannot find it). For those of you who are
beginners in dos syntax you only need one command for this exercise
(*cd*). This command allows you to move between folders. Typing
*cd..* you can move backwards in the folder structure. When you are at
the system root, type *cd C:\\FUSION*. To see what's in the folder,
you can write the *dir* (Figure 6).

.. figure:: /images/Lidar6.jpg
   :alt:  none
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Figure 6. The Windows Command Prompt

Now use the *cd*-command to locate the folder where you saved
**ground.dtm**. You must also make the command prompt "aware" of where
the FUSION algorithms are located. Type the command as shown in Figure 7
(path %PATH%;C:\\FUSION).

.. figure:: /images/Lidar7.jpg
   :alt:  none
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Figure 7. Adding an environment path in the command prompt.

Now you can use all the executable algorithms that are available in the
**C:\\FUSION\\**. Try by typing **gridsurfacecreate**. Now you will see
the documentation available for this specific algorithm. As you want to convert your **.dtm** file you will make use of **DTM2ASCII**. Type the
following command:

    **dtm2ascii /raster ground.dtm**

You have now created an ESRI ASCII grid (in the same folder as
**ground.dtm**) that you now can open QGIS. Open **ground.asc** in QGIS.
You can also open the building footprint polygons from *Fastighetskartan*
(**by\_get.shp**). Do not close the Command Prompt. If you have already
done this, you need set your path to Fusion again.

Create Digital Surface Models using QGIS/FUSION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Digital Surface Model (DSM) is an elevation model that contains the
heights of objects (such as building heights). Usually, ground elevation
is also included. A model containing only ground level elevation is usually
defined as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). There are several ways to
create a DSM. First, you should make use of an additional algorithm from
the command prompt, **PolyClipData**. The algorithm is used to
separate out certain points from the point cloud. Remove **by\_get.shp**
from your QGIS project if the layer is loaded. Locate yourself in the
**LaserData** folder and enter the following command in one line:

    **polyclipdata /outside /class:1
    “c:\\temp\\LidarQGISFUSION\\Fastighetskartan\\by\_get.shp”
    “c:\\temp\\LidarQGISFUSION\\Output\\veg.las” “gvc.las”**

Sometimes the folder paths malfunction. If you get an error
message, try copying the **by\_get.shp** in the same folder as
**gvc.las** and then remove the path from the command. Remember that a shape file consists of many files, i.e. you need to copy all files starting with the name **by_get**. What you did with
the above command was take all the points classified as
*unclassified*, with the switch **/class:1**, and cut them based on the
building footprints with the switch **/outside**. Examine the results
in the FUSION LAS viewer.

Run the same algorithm, but just cut the points that are within the
building footprints. Name the output **buildings.las**.

Finally, cut out all the ground points. Name the output **ground.las**. If you are not able to write the correct syntax, see the solutions at the end of this exercise.

Now let us create a DSM that includes both land and building heights. We
do this, use *Processing Toolbox > FUSION > Surface > Canopy Model* as shown in
Figure 8. In this algorithm we can use the switch **/ascii** and
thereby avoid creating an ESRI ASCII grid afterwards. Instead, an ascii
grid with the same name as your **.dtm** file is now created. Note that
two las files are added as input layers.


.. figure:: /images/Lidar8.jpg
   :alt:  none
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Figure 8. Settings in Canopy Model in order to create a building and ground DSM.

If you are successful, **DSM.dtm** should look like Figure 9.

An asci file has also been created (**DSM.asc**). This is a very simple
raster file format and cannot be e.g. embedded with coordinate system
information. Therefore we need to convert it into another format, e.g. geoTIFF. Open
**DSM.asc** in QGIS and create a geotiff copy by right-clicking and choosing
*Export > Save as...*. Save the GeoTIFF in the Output folder and name it
**DSMtif.tif**. Keep all other settings as standard.

.. figure:: /images/Lidar9.jpg
   :alt:  none
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Figure 9. DSM.dtm.

We will also try to create a DSM which contains only vegetation (trees
and shrubs). This requires some additional steps and to achieve the best
possible results, one needs to undergo a number of filtering processes.
You can study this further in Lindberg and Grimmond (2011). To create a
decent vegetation model, we will use two types of filters. First, we
want to filter out lower points that can be, for example, people or cars. To do this, we use *ClipData*. Unfortunately there is a bug in
the algorithm of running it from the *Processing Toolbox* so we need
to run it from the command prompt. Locate your folder *Output* and enter
the following:

    **clipdata /ground:ground.dtm /zmin:2.5 veg.las veg\_filt.las 318864.0
    319364.0 6397926.0 6398400.0**

This was done to exclude all the points that are lower than 2.5 meters
from our ground model (**/zmin:2.5**). The coordinates at the end are
taken from the extents parameters in **DSM.asc**.

Now you can run the **Canopy Model** again with settings according to
Figure 10.

.. figure:: /images/Lidar10.jpg
   :alt:  none
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Figure 10. Settings in Canopy Model in order to create a vegetation DSM.

Adding **ground.dtm** as **Input Ground DTM layer** normalizes all
values ​​to be meters above ground level instead of meters above the sea
level. Open **cdsm.asc** in QGIS. As you can see, you need to perform
some additional steps before you can be satisfied. The trees have a
lot of "holes", there are also occasional lamp posts, etc. Plus the buildings in the model are visible. This depends on
how the **CanopyModel** algorithm works. You can read more about this
in the manual if you are interested. Let's start by removing buildings.
To do this, create a new polygon layer by buffering the building
footprint layer (**by\_get.shp**) by 2 meters (*Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Buffer*). Set *End cap style* to *Flat* and *Join style* to *Miter*. Name your new shapefile
**by\_buff.shp** and save it in the folder **Fastighetskartan**. We must
also create an additional attribute for **by\_buff.shp** with the value
0. Open the *attribute table* and then the *Field Calculator*
(abacus). Configure the following settings (Figure 11) and click OK. Then
save and close the editor mode (buttons to the top left of the attribute
table).

   Figure 11. How to add a new attribute column containing only zeros.

Now go to the *Raster -> Conversion -> Rasterize* and configure the following
settings as in Figure 12. The Output extent is taken from the
**dsmtif.tif** layer.

.. figure:: /images/Lidar12.jpg
   :alt:  none
   :width: 100%
   :align: center 

   Figure 12. Rasterize in QGIS.

Open the *Raster Calculator* and multiply **buff\_bolean** with **cdsm**.
Call the new layer **cdsm\_filt.tif**. This operation has now removed
vegetation pixels that were present within the buffered buildings.

Unfortunately, the Canopy Model algorithm in FUSION/QGIS is produces
very small elevations when it is normalized against the **ground.dtm**.
Therefore, we need to remove these values from the vegetation raster.
This can be done in the *Raster Calculator* in QGIS. Open *Raster
Calculator* and choose write the following expression in the *Raster
Calculator Expression* Window:

    **(cdsm\_filt@1 > 0.5) \* cdsm\_filt@1**

Call the output file **cdsm\_filt2.tif** and save as a geoTIFF.

Finally, you need to run a majority filter to remove some noise (posts,
etc.) on our vegetation DSM. A majority filter replaces individual
pixels that are surrounded by pixels with the same value. In our case,
for example, a positive pole height value is surrounded by ground pixels
(zeros). This replaces the pixel value to the value that occurs most in
the filter window (usually 3x3), i.e. zero. Search for **Majority
filter** from *SAGA GIS* in the *Processing Toolbox*. Run the filter
algorithm using default settings. Make sure not to remove too many vegetation pixels. This is set by the *Threshold* parameter. Use a temporary output and then export
the layer as a geoTIFF with the name **cdsm\_final**. There are also
other filters that you could make use of. For example, filters to fill gaps in the vegetation or remove linear features (see Linberg and Grimmond 2011). If you feel you have much time left, consider how to fill gaps in vegetation using filtering techniques.

PART 2 - Land Cover data
------------------------

The land cover in UMEP consists of seven classes (buildings, paved, deciduous trees, conifer trees, bare soil and water). This part of the exersice you will make use of the data produced in Part 1. You will try to derive as many classes as possible. 

Buildings and paved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First you need to create a new boolean raster using your building polygon layer. Create a new attribute called zeros in **by_get** and re-run *Rasterize* as in figure 12 but now use **by_get** as the input layer and **build_bolean.tif** as output (*Rasterized*).

Deciduous trees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now create a boolean raster where vegetation = 1 and ground = 0 in the *Raster Calculator*. Call the new layer **veg_bolean.tif** ("cdsm_final@1" > 0). We will not try to separate deciduous and confier here.

Grass
~~~~~
Now open **ground.las** in the FUSION viewer and color point using intensity data (*press the N key*). As shown in Figure 14, each laser pulse returns to the reciever with an intensity. As the laser pulse usually is within the red spectrum, features such as grass (vegetation) has a high intensity and can therefore be identified (Figure 14).

   :alt:  none
   :width: 100%
   :align: center 

   Figure 14. Ground.las visulized based on intensity values.
   
Open *Point cloud analysis > Intensity Image* in FUSION and configure the settings as in Figure 15.

.. figure:: /images/Lidar15.jpg
   :alt:  none
   :width: 75%
   :align: center 

   Figure 15. Settings for the *Intesity Image* tool.
   
This creates a 3 band raster image. You need to add it to your project (**Intensity.bmp**). One simple way to reduce it to only one layer is to use the *Raster Calulator* and only save one of the band. Call the output **Intensity1.tif**. Buildings and other NoData-features are here classified as 255. Reduce these values to zeros using the *Raster Calculator* again (("Intensity1@1"  <  255) * "Intensity1@1"). Call the output layer **Intensity1nodata.tif**. Now try to find a suitable threshold value that can represent the lower value of grass. This can be done by either identifying values using the *Identify tool* (i with a mouse pointer) or you can try to visulize the grass in the *Symbology* tab under *Properties*. This requires some knowledge of the area (i.e. what is grass and what is not) or you can make use of e.g. QuickMapServices-plugin and overlay i.e. Google satellite images. When satisfied (I used >125) create a boolean image where grass has the value 1 and other surfaces 0, using the *Raster Calculator*. Call the layer **lc_bolean.tif**.

Bare soil and water
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is about as far as you can come with a point cloud like this. Bare soil is actually not present within this domain and water usually has no returns back and can therefore be hard to classify. There are techniques to do so, but not within the scope of this tutorial. One possibility is to use a vector dataset (e.g. Figure 1) and extract e.g. water from that dataset and incorporate into the land cover data. Another would be to exploit the fact that lidar returns are almost absent from water bodies (lakes, ponds etc.). You can examine **gvc.las** in the FUSION viewer and spot a small pond in the center of the study area. However, you will also see other areas with no returns, e.g. metal roofs etc. This makes deriving water bodies a bit of a challenge, but not impossible. You can use e.g. *FillNoData* in the processing toolbox to try to derive water.

Merging into on land cover grid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make use of the *Raster Calculator* again using the following syntax:

   **("build_bolean@1") + ("lc_bolean@1" * 2) + (("build_bolean@1" * "veg_bolean@1") * 3)** 

Call the output **landcover_raw.tif**.

Finally, you need to appoint the correct values to the different classes. That can be done using *UMEP > Pre-Processor > Urban Land Cover > Land Cover Reclassifier*. You can qualitatively check your land cover classification against satellite imagery, such as the *Google Satellite* in *QuickMapServices*.
